How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It narrowed down the area to look for the bug, making it easier to find

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Use less time to look for errors if a new version doesnot work as well as an older version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual saving allows for completion of a logical action, while automatic saving can save in the middle of a logical change resulting in a project that cannot run or is hard to understand

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Related files are important for the correct functioning of a program and thus all files must be saved to be able to compare to other versions

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to find the commit id's which you want to compare and compare with git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It allows you to make changes without worrying about breaking something, because you can roll back to a previous version at any time and check out the differences in code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Upload working documents
