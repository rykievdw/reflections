When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When there's more than one person working on a file or when you are working from a different computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    That way you know which changes were committed and you can decide whether it is really improvement before importing (e.g. when another person made a commit on GitHub)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is when you make a copy of someone else's repository through GitHub, while a clone is when you make a copy of someone else's repository from the command line.  A branch is when your app is split into different versions of functionality and you want to work on each split separately until they can be merged again.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If someone make changes which is not running too good, you can push the working state.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Use app like dropbox, although it will be harder to keep track of changes and more prone to error with less functionality than GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you want to test a new concept with your app or when you are part of a team working on the same application with different responsibilities. The benefit is that you protect your working master file.
